# Better Carjacking

A GTA V mod that allows peds to simply flee their vehicle when targeted.

# Building Instructions
1. Make sure you have .NET Framework 4.8 installed.
2. Open `BetterCarjacking.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Go to Refrences in the Solution Explorer and set the location for ScriptHookVDotNet3
4. Go to the `Build` tab then `Build BetterCarjacking`

NOTE: Build Events are set to my copy of GTA V located at `F:\Games\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V`, you will need to change it if installed elsewhere

# Installation and Dependencies
You need to have ScriptHookV and ScriptHookVDotNet 3 installed.  
Move BetterCarjacking.dll and BetterCarjacking.ini into your scripts folder

# Usage
Point a gun at a driver in a car. They have a 60% chance (by default) to drive backwards or forwards like normal or they could flee, giving you the car to take.
